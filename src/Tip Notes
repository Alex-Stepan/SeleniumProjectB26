Notes for creating the project Framework:

1.  Create project based on Maven and gave a name com.<Project name>
2.  Add in pom.xml next dependencies from https://mvnrepository.com/:
        2.1. selenium-java 3.141.59
        2.2. bonigarcia --> webdrivermanager 5.1.0
3.  Create .gitignore file under project
        /.idea/
        /target/
        /.iml/
4.  Every time verify to have last version of Chrome/Firefox/...
        or you can use WebDriverManager for that
5.  Create com.<project> for using webApp testing under test/java/ folders
